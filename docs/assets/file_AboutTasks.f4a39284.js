First, make sure they&#39;re stated as an action (i.e. start with a verb), then ask yourself <em data-v-3e9a0c17> &quot;Would I be willing to work late to get this item completed?&quot; </em>. If the answer is no, put them in the Opportunity list instead. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Place in the <b data-v-3e9a0c17>Opportunity</b> list both ideas that you want to think about 1-2 more days before deciding on their urgency and tasks you&#39;d tackle whenever you found a gap in your schedule. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Send to the <b data-v-3e9a0c17>Horizon</b> list any item that doesn&#39;t meet the previous criteria and could wait for more than 10 days to complete. </li></ul><h4 class="title is-5 pt-5 mb-4" data-v-3e9a0c17>List Sizes</h4><p data-v-3e9a0c17> In order to make the most out of each list, the number of items they hold has to be limited: </p><ul data-v-3e9a0c17><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Try to keep the Critical list <b data-v-3e9a0c17>under 5 items</b> and never let it go over 10 items. Any larger than that and important things will start slipping through the cracks. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Limit the Opportunity list to <b data-v-3e9a0c17>up to 20 items</b> in order to be able to scan through them all in one glance. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Don&#39;t worry about the Horizon list that much: it can get as big as necessary as it serves as a catch-all for things. </li></ul><h4 class="title is-5 pt-5 mb-4" data-v-3e9a0c17>List Review Cycles</h4><p data-v-3e9a0c17>Each list gets reviewed at its own frequency:</p><ul data-v-3e9a0c17><li data-v-3e9a0c17>Review Critical items once <b data-v-3e9a0c17>each hour</b>.</li><li data-v-3e9a0c17> Review Opportunity items <b data-v-3e9a0c17>once a day</b> after you&#39;re done with your Critical tasks. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17>Review Horizon items <b data-v-3e9a0c17>once a week</b>.</li></ul><h4 class="title is-5 pt-5 mb-4" data-v-3e9a0c17>List Prioritization</h4><p data-v-3e9a0c17> Each list works under the &quot;fresh principle&quot;: it gives prominence to the items you intend to deal closest to today. This is where Start Dates come to play: </p><ul data-v-3e9a0c17><li data-v-3e9a0c17><b data-v-3e9a0c17>Start Dates</b> determine where and when tasks will be displayed on their list: tasks starting today will always appear at their top, older tasks will be displayed further down the list (for better or for worse, they are &quot;over their prime time&quot;), and future tasks will be hidden until their time comes. </li><li data-v-3e9a0c17><b data-v-3e9a0c17>Due Dates</b> should only be used for tasks that actually have a deadline. Don&#39;t put artificial due dates to trick yourself into getting things done. </li></ul></div></article>',1),y=v(()=>e("h3",{class:"title is-5 tasklist-title"},"Usual Workflow",-1)),b=i("<p data-v-3e9a0c17> As previously mentioned, <b data-v-3e9a0c17>Start Dates</b> greatly determine what appears at the top of each list. You can change dates manually (except for Critical tasks); however, the app also offers useful <b data-v-3e9a0c17>Refresh</b> and <b data-v-3e9a0c17>Postpone</b> actions that&#39;ll change dates for you in order to quickly move tasks up and down (or even hide from) their list so you can focus on the top contenders. </p><ul data-v-3e9a0c17><li data-v-3e9a0c17><b data-v-3e9a0c17>Start the day </b> taking care of Critical items right off the bat.
