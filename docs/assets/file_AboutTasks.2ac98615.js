First, make sure they&#39;re stated as an action (start with a verb), then ask yourself <em data-v-22fd7038> &quot;Would I be willing to work late to get this item completed?&quot; </em>. If the answer is no, put them in the Opportunity list instead. </li><li data-v-22fd7038> Place in the <b data-v-22fd7038>Opportunity</b> list either ideas that you want to think about 1-2 more days before deciding on their urgency. New thoughts that pop into your mind should go into this list by default. </li><li data-v-22fd7038> Send to the <b data-v-22fd7038>Horizon</b> list any item that doesn&#39;t meet the previous criteria and could wait for more than 10 days to complete. </li></ul><h4 class="title is-5 pt-5 mb-4" data-v-22fd7038>List Sizes</h4><p data-v-22fd7038> In order to make the most out of each list, the number of items they hold has to be limited: </p><ul data-v-22fd7038><li data-v-22fd7038> Try to keep the Critical list <b data-v-22fd7038>under 5 items</b> and never let it go over 10 items.
